# DynamicalCompensation-Viz
Code used to make vizualisations in "Ideal adaptive control in biological systems--an analysis of P-invariance and dynamical compensation properties".

## Implementation Details

- All simulations are implemented in MATLAB 2023a.
- To generate the results of the numerical simulation, please run:

    - `DC_phase_portrait.m`: Generates the phase portrait of the system (Figure 2).
    - `DC_impulse_response.m`: Generates the step-like input response (Figures 3 to 5).
